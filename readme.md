#README:
We are Globetrotter, a full-stack development team that has created a mobile responsive application to give you real time currency exchange rates, hotel accommodations, local entertainment and transportation costs needed when planning and budgeting a trip before you arrive at your destination. As always, feel free to let us know if you have any questions or concerns by reaching out to us at the contact information included below. Thank you.

#Development:
Globetrotter was developed by a group of three Codeup student developers in September 2017 as a Capstone Project in San Antonio Tx. The creation of Globetrotter was during a two week time frame in which the development team dedicated their time and effort to ensure the end product was a successful reliable travel site.

Globetrotter is an application built using a Laravel wireframe needed for large applications using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and JQuery which then queries an API with cost data info from more than 30,000 locations, making it a user friendly, easy to use website with some custom CSS.
